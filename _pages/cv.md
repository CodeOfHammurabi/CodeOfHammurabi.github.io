Here's a link to a PDF version of my CV (last updated 27 July 2024): [Krishna's CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aLVRF6_B0FB8L47-2rlujYC3oWBK92lB/view?usp=sharing)

Education
======
* BS-MS Dual Degree in Biology, minor in Mathematics (with Distinction), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune: 2019-2024
  * 9.1/10 GPA (top 5% of graduating class of 210)
  * Masters' Thesis: Assessing the sensitivity of microbial communities to external perturbations (Supervisor: Prof. Serguei Saavedra, Massachusetts Institute of Technology)  

Projects and work experience
======
* September 2024 onwards: Research Engineer, ISEM, Univ. of Montpellier
  * Quantifying the effect of climate tipping points on global biodiversity
  * As part of the [CLIMTIP project](https://www.climate-tipping-points.eu/), I am investigating extinction risks induced by crossing climatic tipping points. Using current species distributions and climate simulations, I am identifying susceptibility based on niche reconstructions and identifying refugia.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Vasilis Dakos, Prof. Claire Jacquet

* June 2023 - May 2024: Masters' Thesis Student, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  * Assessing the sensitivity of microbial communities to external perturbations
  * Using empirical dynamic modeling and causal inference methods on long-term datasets from the human gut microbiota, my thesis dealt with non-parametric nonlinear prediction of perturbation effects and extent of recovery in large interacting ecosystems. 
  * Supervisor: Prof. Serguei Saavedra
 
* January 2023 - May 2023: Undergraduate Researcher, Dept. of Biology, IISER Pune
  * Meta-analysis of plant thermotolerance acclimation
  * **Publication in prep.** Meta-analysis of studies assessing the plasticity of thermal maxima in plants under different environmental conditions. By collecting factors and traits that could govern the strength of acclimation response, I aim to use this as a predictor of future climatic risk.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Deepak Barua
    
* May 2020 - December 2022: Undergraduate Researcher, Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc)
  * Harnessing community science data to predict upward range shifts in montane birds
  * **One publication, second in prep.** Developing novel tools to detect montane range shifts in bird populations using community science data. Using global hotspots of bird observations, developing novel techniques for detecting extent of range shifts and therefore risk of habitat loss in the future.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Umesh Srinivasan
 
* May 2020 - December 2022: Undergraduate Researcher, Dept. of Data Science, IISER Pune
  * Characterizing Intron Splicing Sites Using Unsupervised Clustering
  * Using unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms and genome data, investigated nucleotides determining intron splicing sites in the fruit fly genome. Different architectures and their associated functional roles were identified.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Leelavati Narlikar

Other Projects
======
* Summer 2022: Summer Intern, Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University
  * Spatial Models of Higher-Order Interactions
  * Using analytical formulations from statistical mechanics and numerical computer simulations, worked on how spatial structure in ecosystems may mediate the effects of higher-order interactions on species coexistence.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Jonathan Levine
 
* Summer 2021: Summer Intern, Dept. of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago
  * Modeling Sign-feasibility in Random Ecosystems
  * Applying theorems from combinatorial matrix theory, aimed to look at sign-feasibility, that is, when coexistence of species in ecosystems may occur independent of species interaction strength, depending only on sign of interaction.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Stefano Allesina

Skills

* Statistical Analysis and GLMs
* Causal Inference
* High-dimensional Data Analytics
